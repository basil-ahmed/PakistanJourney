# Journey Through Pakistan 

[Link To Website](https://basil-ahmed.github.io/PakistanJourney/)

### Project Description:
	
  The website takes the user on a journey through Pakistan, a country full of ethnic diversity. It informs about the country’s five provinces namely: Punjab, Sindh, Balochistan, KPK and Gilgit-Baltistan. Each province with its captivating and rich historical background, colorful culture and traditions, distinguishable architecture and delectable cuisine.
  
The website initially provides a brief context about the country and then goes on to display Pakistan’s map after the user clicks on the “To Pakistan”  button. The map is not just an ordinary map but when you hover over each province it gets highlighted and if you click on it, it displays an image that represents the specific province and plays a sound piece that has been recorded by the team members which gives the user an insight into that province such as facts and information about its culture, people, food and what makes that province distinguishable from the others. To make it more fun and preceptive we have background music added to each of the sound pieces that is unique and representative to each and every province.
Just as the name of our project states we hope to provide the user with a unique but fun experience that undertakes them on a trip to Pakistan and so they can experience its rich and diverse culture, be it a virtual trip but through the power of sound and music we aim to bring Pakistan and its unparalleled and alluring culture to each one of our users.   


### Process:

We started off by having Javeria write the script for us which would be used in our audio recording. She researched about the individual provinces and provided us with the information and lines. After she sent us the lines we made some edits and tweaks, Ramsha and Mohid started recording the audio turn by turn for all the individual provinces. They also did further research on their own as we felt like adding in more information that goes deeper into the culture rather than talking about just surface level details. All the while, Basil was in charge of making the website and also creating an SVG of the Pakistani map which was used for the interactivity part. Once Ramsha and Mohid were done with the audio, Ramsha quickly cleaned up any background noise from the audio files to create a cleaner sound file. These were then added onto the website to create a virtual tour of Pakistan!

### Reflection/Evaluation:

  Since sound is such a powerful form of medium and music is such an integral part of one’s life we wanted to bring forth a project that played with both of these strengths and so we decided to capitalize on the idea of  a site-specific experience and so came into being our project “Journey Through Pakistan”. From the very beginning we wanted to do something fun and different and so we decided why not take the user on a virtual trip to Pakistan, a place that is so culturally diverse but sadly unbeknownst to many. We were quite successful in releasing this project because we managed to incorporate all the things we had planned and brainstormed in our meetings such as we wanted to have traditional music playing in the background of each of our soundpiece and we wanted an interactive map that represented Pakistan. Initially we had planned to do the dialogues of each province in its own provincial language but sadly we couldn't do so as we couldn’t find people who spoke each of the five languages and later on we also realized that keeping it in English was better as it would be comprehensible to our users and the project’s main aim was to utilize the power of sound take the user on a journey.
